# Hay Day session April 11th 2021

I had a very long Hay Day session today. I made a lot of progress.

## Farm

I was on the farm in Hay Day today, and I made significant progress.

### Farm workers

My farm workers helped out while I was gone, but it wasn't very obvious to me for most of the session.

### Lots of collection

I did tons of collection today of various products and crops.

### Boosts

I used a 2x XP boost today and went from 41980 XP to 49849 XP today.

### Remodeling

I did some remodeling of my farm today, and made it look better and more unique. I found out that this whole time, I could move dead trees around. Also, there was an unharvested raspberry bush hidden on my farm.

### Production

I did tons of production today for boat orders, and town visitors. I produced items in all production buildings today, and maxed out all my smeltors, with more ore to smelt, even when spending diamonds on a new slot.

## Fishing

I did fishing on my farm as usual today.

### Stock depletion

I am working on depleting my stock of fishing items, such as nets and free lures, so that I can evenly build them back up again today.

## Town

I did a lot of work in my town today in Hay Day.

### Tourism

I have been producing tons of goods for the town, and I was able to serve over 4 visitors today.

### Expansion

I was quick in a purchase, and bought 10 map pieces. I was able to expand my town, and earn an achievement, along with unlock the sanctuary.

### Sanctuary

I began to unlock the sanctuary today at the cost of 1 expansion, and 10000 coins. I will be able to see what it is like in next weeks session.

### Helping users

I helped 1 user today when buying the map pieces by saving one of their trees, and helping them fill in 1 town order with 5 of my honey pots (which I didn't have much use for anyways)

## Other

Other info for today.

### Bot epidemic

There has been a lot of reports lately of bot accounts selling stuff by mass-growing wheat (which produces the most amount of bonus items quickly) If it wasn't already obvious, I am not a bot in this game. Currently, I am fine with these specific bots, as they are only helping players get rare resources.

### Long session

I had a very long session today, one of my top 20 longest sessions to date.

### Corruption

Currently, 2 out of 999 image files are corrupted. Future technology might be needed to correct these issues.

## Overview

See above.
