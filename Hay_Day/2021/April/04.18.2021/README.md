# Hay Day session April 18th 2021

I had a very long session again today, and I got a lot done.

## Farm

I played extensively on the farm today.

### Crops

I grew various crops today, and used a boost to make soybeans, sugarcane, and indigo grow faster. I grew tons of crops, mostly wheat, carrots, corn, and sugarcane.

### Achievements

I earned the hyper herder achievement today for collecting from animals 60 times in 45 minutes. I didn't think I would earn the achievement so early on.

### Sales

I sold lots of rare things in the roadside shop today. I have now noted that these bots are a real problem, as they are preventing people from buying stuff at full price (such as wheat) while not a bad thing alone, it hurts many players chances of getting farther when people buy wheat for 1 coin from bots and no-one buys their wheat, letting their shop stay full.

### Remodeling

I did some brief remodeling today and moved some things around. Some notable changes being expanding my wheat area from 18 plots to 24 plots, and adding paths around my unused dog house.

### Production

I produced tons of goods today, but have been saving them for the town. I also loaded 36 milk jugs onto the river boat.

### Greg

I did the usual collection from Greg today.

### Collecting

I collected from my trees and bushes again today.

### Honey

I collected lots of nectar today, and I am getting a lot closer to getting a 2nd beehive.

## Fishing area

I played briefly in the fishing area today. In real life, there are some people visiting with us, they weren't here at the time, but I took a break and played a match of Puyo Puyo Tetris with my family.

### Nets

I used 3 nets today and produced 3 more. I am mostly working on cutting down on lures.

### Fish

I caught some fish today and collected 12 fish fillets.

### Cutting down stock

I am cutting down on stock in my tackle box. Right now, I am cutting down on the number of free lures. After I cut it down significantly, I will work on cutting down on the amount of nets.

## City

I played in the city a bit today.

### Serving

I served several people in my city today, and got a lot closer to level 5 city reputation.

### Sanctuary

I unlocked the sanctuary today. It is a fun little area, and it will be more fun next week.

#### Habitats

I unlocked the hippo habitat today, which was built for free. I have found that the bundles of wheat actually make wheat more valuable in quantity, so I will work on selling more wheat now. Wheat isn't the most useless item in the game for me now. Since 3 animal feed packets worth of wheat require 75 wheat to produce (25 each) I have to grow wheat for ~8=10+ minutes to get enough for 1 feed. This makes wheat an item that I don't have to sell as much of in the roadside shop.

## Overview

See above.
