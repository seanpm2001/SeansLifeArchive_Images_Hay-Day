# Hay Day session April 4th 2021

I had a very long and excessive Hay Day session today.

## Farm

My session today was one of my longest Hay Day sessions ever. I don't remember the last time I played long enough to be able to harvest Indigo twice plus over 30 minutes more.

### Boosts

I went through most of my boosts today, just to clear booster space. I used Tom once today for a town quest, but trashed the boost afterwards, as I wouldn't be playing an extra 2 hours just to use Tom once again.

### Sales

I made many sales today, selling excessive building parts, crops, and products.

### Crops

I harvested tons of crops today.

Most harvested crops (April 4th 2021)

1. Wheat: 500+

2. Corn: 60+

3. Carrots: 40+ (+20 purchased)

4. Sugarcane: 36+

5. Soybean: 20+

6. Indigo: 6x

7. Cotton: 6x (+20 purchased)

8. Potatoes: 3x

9. Pumpkins: 3x

10. Strawberries: 3x

11. Tomatoes: 3x

12. No other crops listed

I also re-arranged some crops and bought some decorations, as I intend to produce more Indigo and Cotton, and no Pumpkins or Strawberries (for the moment)

Also, I harvested blackberries, apples, and cocoa leaves for some town quests.

#### Filling the silo

I filled the silo several times today, and had to sell crops using my entire roadside shop.

### Production

I did lots of production today, producing various crops, ores, animal feed, and animal products.

### Preparing for next week

I activated both helpers (1 through a booster, and 1 through an ad) so that I can produce crops while I am gone, since some of the slots were busy producing products that take over an hour each.

## Fishing area

I used 1 net for the farm pass today, and made 4 normal fishing trips. I am working on emptying out my tacklebox a bit.

## City area

I made some progress in the City area, and produced many goods for a lot of the townpeople, with more to come.

## Overall

I had a good time, and made decent progress, although the session lasted way too long.
