# Hay Day session May 2nd 2021

I had a long Hay Day session again today.

## Farm

I worked a lot on my farm today.

### Boosts

I used a boost to get Tom for free for 25 hours (but only for less than 2 hours in my session) unfortunately, you cannot get upgrade parts (duct tape, screws, planks, boards, nails, bolts) with Tom. I didn't want to completely waste the boost, so I requested saws, as I have been pretty low on them lately.

### Crops

I grew the usual crops today in mass quantity, especially wheat, carrots, and sugarcane. I also collected from fruit trees and berry bushes, revived some, and cut some down. I am low on saws, so I couldn't cut all the dead trees down. I made some progress on this goal today.

### Production

I did production in almost all production buildings today, as I didn't produce anything in the jeweler. I was a bit slow on filling certain production buildings.

### Mining

I briefly did some mining today, I have stopped hoarding ingots completely now, and am a lot more willing to turn it into jewelery or just sell it.

### Roadside shop

I sold tons of product in the roadside shop today.

### Truck orders

I was able to do 1 truck order today.

### Bee farming

I did some honey farming today, and collected 3 honeycombs. A few pollen bushes died and had to be revived. Next week, I will get a double beehive.

### Level progress

I made significant progress in level 40 today. I got 6700 xp from 1 farm pass goal, along with over 2000 XP from other tasks. If I had an XP boost active, I could have made much more progress.

### Ranching

I did some ranching with various animals today, but didn't help my pigs today (didn't re-feed them)

## Fishing

I briefly played in the fishing area today.

### Fishing

I fished in 2 fishing spots with normal lures to get rid of them.

### Netfishing

I collected several fish fillet with 3 fish nets today.

### Stock reduction

I reduced my stock on normal lures by 2. I am continuing to reduce 

## Town

I played a bit in the town today.

### Visitors

I served a few visitors today. I have a new building today, but none of the current visitors visited it (probably because I didn't receive visitors from after its construction completed)

### Sanctuary

The sanctuary wasn't very interesting today. The 1 wheat stock only grants 25 xp, and the hippo doesn't do much.

I didn't do very much on the sanctuary today, I only fed the hippo.

## Overview

See above.
