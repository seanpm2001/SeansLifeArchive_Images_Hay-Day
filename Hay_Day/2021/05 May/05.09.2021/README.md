# Hay Day session May 9th 2021

I had a long Hay Day session again today.

## Farm

I worked a lot on my farm today.

### Boosts

I used a boost to get Tom for free for 13 hours (but only for less than 2 hours in my session) unfortunately, you cannot get upgrade parts (duct tape, screws, planks, boards, nails, bolts) with Tom, I found that out last week. Today, I didn't feel as stressed about the dead trees, so I got pickaxes and did further mining. It will take a while to use up all the ore, I filled up all my smelters.

### Crops

I grew the usual crops today in mass quantity, especially wheat, carrots, and sugarcane. I also collected from fruit trees and berry bushes, revived some, and cut some down. I am low on saws, so I couldn't cut all the dead trees down. I made some progress on this goal today.

### Production

I did production in almost all production buildings today, as I didn't produce anything in the jeweler or the sewing machine. I was up to normal speed on collecting and restocking production buildings.

### Mining

I did some mining today, I have stopped hoarding ingots completely now, and am a lot more willing to turn it into jewelery or just sell it.

### Roadside shop

I sold tons of product in the roadside shop today.

### Truck orders

I didn't do any truck orders today.

### Bee farming

I did some honey farming today, and collected several honeycombs. Today, I got a double beehive, but the requirement to get a triple beehive is insane, and will take 5x longer to get the third beehive than to get the second behive.

### Level progress

I made significant level progress today, farming thousands of XP.

### Ranching

I did some ranching with various animals today.

## Fishing

I briefly played in the fishing area today.

### Fishing

I fished in 2 fishing spots with normal lures to get rid of them.

### Netfishing

I collected several fish fillet with 3 fish nets today.

### Stock reduction

I reduced my stock on normal lures by 2 (down to 32) I am continuing to reduce the amount of lures I have stocked up.

## Town

I played a bit in the town today.

### Visitors

I served several visitors today. I also upgraded my bed n breakfast, and got 2 visitors there.

### Sanctuary

The sanctuary wasn't very interesting today. The 1 wheat stock only grants 25 xp, and the hippo doesn't do much.

I didn't do very much on the sanctuary today, I only fed the hippo.

## Overview

See above.
