# Hay Day session June 27th 2021

I had a very long and excessive length Hay Day session today.

## Farm

I worked a lot on my farm today.

### Boosts

I used 1 boost today, so that I could use Tom today. I also did an ad boost to use a farm helper.

### Crops

I grew the usual crops today in mass quantity, especially wheat, carrots, and sugarcane. I also collected from fruit trees and berry bushes, revived some, and cut some down. I was finally able to cut down all dead trees and bushes last week, but I am behind on it again now.

### Production

<!--
I did production in almost all production buildings today, as I didn't produce anything in the jeweler. I was up to normal speed on collecting and restocking production buildings.!-->

I did production in almost all production buildings today, the only building I didn't use was the jeweler.

### Mining

I did some mining today, I have stopped hoarding ingots completely now, and am a lot more willing to turn it into jewelery or just sell it.

### Roadside shop

I sold a lot on the roadside shop today, and made over 9000 coins.

### Truck orders

I did not do any truck orders today.

### Bee farming

I did some honey farming today, and collected several honeycombs. 5 weeks ago, I got a double beehive, but the requirement to get a triple beehive is insane, and will take 5x longer to get the third beehive than to get the second behive. I am now 4.2/40th (or 42/400 or 4200/40000) of the way there. I made some progress today.

### Level progress

I made a large amount of level progress today, but it was still progress.

### Ranching

I did some ranching with various animals today.

## Fishing

I briefly played in the fishing area today.

### Fishing

I fished in 2 fishing spots with normal lures to get rid of them.

### Netfishing

I collected several fish fillet with 3 fish nets today.

### Stock reduction

I reduced my stock on normal lures by 2 (down to 18) I am continuing to reduce the amount of lures I have stocked up.

### Farm pass

I made some progress with the farm pass today, and unlocked a few rewards.

## Town

I played a bit in the town today.

### Visitors

I received a few visitors today. I was able to serve several of them today.

### Sanctuary

The sanctuary wasn't very interesting today. The 1 wheat stock only grants 25 xp, and the hippo doesn't do much, I only fed it today. I didn't do any decorating.

## Neighbors

### Greg

I visited Greg today.

## Overview

See above.
